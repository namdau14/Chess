# Chess_Nam_Dau

Chess program coded by me to practice OOP Projects and System Design. I followed the instruction from this youtube series: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnYui0e73Rs&list=PLBwF487qi8MGU81nDGaeNE1EnNEPYWKY_&index=2
and added in my own implementation

To run the program, simply install python and its library pygame
```
pip install pygame
```

then run the file `chess_display.py`

I am plannig to eventually develop a front-end and host this on a website as well
